                            Hi, I'm Sahil Shaikh from Mumbai, India. I'm a Computer Science student who has been fascinated by technology from a young age. Alongside my studies, I help run my family’s leather belt business, which has given me hands-on experience in tech and problem-solving.
                            <br><br>
                            When I’m not immersed in tech, you’ll find me exploring new places, swimming, or simply enjoying life’s little adventures. I’m always excited to learn new things and see how technology can make a difference in everyday life.
                            <br><br>
